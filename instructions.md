## Hours to Complete

# Overview


## Project Goals
Create a quiz app that allows users to create topics, quizzes, and flashcards and interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards over.

## Project Requirements

- Build the application using React and Redux Toolkit
- Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
- Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project including:
  - The purpose of your project
  - Technologies used
  - Features
  - Future work
- Your application is deployed and accessible by users

### Features

- Users can create topics
- Users can create quizzes that:
  - Are associated with topics
  – Contain lists of flashcards
- Users can view all topics
- Users can view an individual topic and all quizzes for that topic
- Users can view an individual quiz and flip cards over

## Prerequisites

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux Toolkit
- Git and GitHub

## Setup
The quickest way to set up your app is to use [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) with [the Redux flag](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/quick-start#using-create-react-app) in order to automatically include Redux.

### `uuid`
This app uses [`uuid`]([the documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)) to create unique identifiers for topics/quizzes/cards. We will be using the [`v4` function](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid#uuidv4options-buffer-offset), so take a moment to read that section of the docs before continuing on.   

### `react-router`
This app uses `react-router` to handle routing between different pages. Since `react-router` is outside the scope of this project, we've written the routing code for you, but if you're curious about how it works, you can explore `App.js` (where the routes for this app are defined) and read the [`react-router` docs](https://reactrouter.com/).

## Sharing

Great work! Visit [our forums](TODO:REPLACE_ME) to compare your project to our sample solution code. After you host your own solution on GitHub, be sure to share it with other learners and see how other learners have built their own projects!

Your solution might look different from ours, and that’s okay! There are multiple ways to solve these projects, and you’ll learn more by seeing others’ code.
